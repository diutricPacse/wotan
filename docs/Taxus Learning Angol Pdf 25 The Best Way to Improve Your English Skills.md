Taxus Learning is based on the principle of natural language acquisition. It is inspired by the way children learn their native language. Children do not learn grammar rules or memorize vocabulary lists. They learn by listening and imitating what they hear. They learn by making mistakes and correcting themselves. They learn by having fun and being curious.
 
Taxus Learning applies the same principle to learning English. It exposes you to authentic and meaningful English content that is relevant to your interests and goals. It helps you to develop your listening and speaking skills first, before moving on to reading and writing. It allows you to learn from your mistakes and improve your pronunciation and fluency. It encourages you to have fun and be curious about English.
 
Taxus Learning is different from other methods of learning English. It does not use textbooks, grammar exercises or boring drills. It does not force you to follow a fixed curriculum or schedule. It does not test you or grade you. It does not make you feel stressed or frustrated. It does not make you hate English.
