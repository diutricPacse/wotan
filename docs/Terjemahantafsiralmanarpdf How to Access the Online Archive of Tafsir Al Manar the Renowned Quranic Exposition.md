The book consists of 12 volumes and covers the entire Quran. It was published in Cairo between 1898 and 1935. Rida used various sources of interpretation, such as the Quran itself, the hadith, the opinions of the companions and the successors, the linguistic analysis, and the rational arguments. He also consulted modern sciences, such as history, geography, astronomy, and sociology.
 
Rida's main contribution was to emphasize the universal and rational aspects of Islam. He rejected blind imitation (taqlid) of the past authorities and advocated independent reasoning (ijtihad) based on the Quran and the Sunnah. He also rejected literalism and extremism and promoted moderation and tolerance. He addressed various issues of his time, such as colonialism, nationalism, democracy, women's rights, and sectarianism.
 
Tafsir al manar is considered one of the most influential works of modern Islamic thought. It has been translated into several languages, including English, French, Turkish, Urdu, and Indonesian. It is widely read and studied by Muslims and non-Muslims alike who seek a deeper understanding of the Quran and its relevance to the contemporary world.

One of the distinctive features of Tafsir al manar is its method of thematic interpretation. Rida did not follow the traditional order of the Quranic verses, but rather grouped them according to their topics and meanings. He also divided the Quran into seven main themes: faith, worship, morality, law, history, prophecy, and science. He explained each theme in detail and showed its connection to the other themes.
 
Rida also paid attention to the historical context of the Quranic revelation. He distinguished between the universal and the specific verses, and between the permanent and the temporary rulings. He argued that some verses were revealed to address particular situations or events in the life of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions, and that they should not be applied literally or indiscriminately to other times and places. He also suggested that some verses were abrogated by later verses or by the consensus of the Muslim community.
 
Another aspect of Tafsir al manar is its social and political orientation. Rida was concerned with the decline and stagnation of the Muslim world and its subjugation by the Western powers. He believed that Islam was compatible with modern civilization and that Muslims should adopt its positive aspects, such as democracy, human rights, education, and science. He also called for the unity and cooperation of the Muslim nations and their resistance against colonialism and imperialism.
