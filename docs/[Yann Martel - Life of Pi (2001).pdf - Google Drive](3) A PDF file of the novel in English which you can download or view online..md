If you are curious about the plot of Life of Pi, here is a brief summary of the novel. The novel is divided into three parts. In the first part, we learn about Pi's childhood in India, where he lives with his family and their zoo animals. Pi is fascinated by religion and explores Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. He also develops a bond with a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, who lives in the zoo.
 
In the second part, Pi's family decides to emigrate to Canada and sell their animals to North American zoos. They board a cargo ship with some of the animals, but the ship sinks in a storm. Pi is the only human survivor and he finds himself on a lifeboat with four animals: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and Richard Parker. The animals soon start to kill each other until only Pi and Richard Parker are left. Pi has to find a way to survive and coexist with the tiger, who he tries to tame with a whistle and food. Pi also has to deal with hunger, thirst, loneliness, and fear.
 
In the third part, Pi and Richard Parker reach the coast of Mexico after 227 days at sea. Pi is rescued and taken to a hospital, where he tells his story to two Japanese officials who are investigating the shipwreck. They do not believe his story and ask him to tell them another version that is more realistic. Pi then tells them a different story, in which he shares the lifeboat with a sailor, a cook, and his mother. The cook kills the sailor and Pi's mother and Pi kills the cook. He implies that the animals in his first story are metaphors for the humans in his second story. The officials note that both stories have the same ending: Pi survives and Richard Parker disappears into the jungle. They prefer the first story and write it in their report.
 
Life of Pi is a novel that explores themes such as faith, survival, storytelling, and the relationship between humans and animals. It is also a novel that challenges our perception of reality and invites us to question what we believe.
