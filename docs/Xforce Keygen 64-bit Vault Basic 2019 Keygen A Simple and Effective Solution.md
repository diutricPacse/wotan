After activating Vault Basic 2019 with Xforce Keygen 64-bit, you may want to learn how to use the software to manage your design data. Vault Basic 2019 is a data management tool that integrates with Autodesk products, such as AutoCAD, Inventor, Revit, etc. It allows you to store, organize, and track your design files in a centralized location. You can also collaborate with other users and access your data from anywhere.
 
To use Vault Basic 2019, you need to install the Vault client on your computer. The Vault client is a software application that connects to the Vault server, where your data is stored. You can download the Vault client from the Autodesk website or from the installation media of your Autodesk product[^2^]. Before installing the Vault client, make sure you have an existing Autodesk product installed on your computer, such as AutoCAD, AutoCAD Map 3D, or AutoCAD Civil 3D.
 
Once you have installed the Vault client, you can access it from your Autodesk product or from the Windows Start menu. The Vault client allows you to upload files to the Vault server, such as PDFs, Word docs, and Excel worksheets. However, you cannot upload DWG files directly from the Vault client. You can only check DWG files in and out through your Autodesk product[^2^]. To do this, you need to use the Vault plug-in that is included with your Autodesk product. The Vault plug-in adds a Vault tab to your product's ribbon interface, where you can perform various tasks related to Vault.
 
Some of the tasks you can do with the Vault plug-in are:

- Create a new project in Vault and add files to it.
- Check out files from Vault and edit them in your Autodesk product.
- Check in files to Vault and add comments or versions.
- Search for files in Vault using various criteria.
- View file properties and history in Vault.
- Compare file versions and see changes.
- Copy or move files within Vault.
- Delete or restore files from Vault.

By using Vault Basic 2019 with your Autodesk product, you can improve your workflow and productivity. You can also ensure that your design data is secure and up-to-date. For more information on how to use Vault Basic 2019, you can watch some video tutorials on YouTube[^1^] [^3^] or visit the Autodesk Knowledge Network[^2^].
