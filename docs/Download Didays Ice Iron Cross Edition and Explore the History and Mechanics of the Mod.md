> "Diday's ICE - Iron Cross Edition: The best mod for HOI3 in my opinion. It adds so much content and features that make the game more enjoyable and challenging. The AI is also much smarter and more aggressive. The only downside is that it can be very hard to play as a minor nation or a non-aligned country."

> "Diday's ICE - Iron Cross Edition: I tried it once and never again. It was too complicated and frustrating for me. I couldn't figure out how to manage my economy, production, research, diplomacy, etc. The game was also very slow and crashed a lot. I prefer simpler mods like Black ICE or Historical Plausibility Project."
