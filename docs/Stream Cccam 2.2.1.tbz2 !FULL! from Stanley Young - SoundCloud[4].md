4. Navigate to the /etc folder of your Dreambox and transfer the cccam.cfg file from your computer to this folder.

6. Disconnect your FTP client software and switch to your Dreambox remote control.
7. Press the blue button twice on your remote to open the blue panel menu.
8. Select Manual Package Install and choose the CCcam 2.2.1 tbz2 file from the list. Press OK to install it.
