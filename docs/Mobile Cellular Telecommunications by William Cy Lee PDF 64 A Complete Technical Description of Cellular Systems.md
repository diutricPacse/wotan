One of the strengths of the book is that it covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of cellular systems. The book explains the mathematical models and formulas that are used to analyze and design cellular systems, as well as the engineering considerations and trade-offs that are involved in implementing and operating them. The book also provides real-world examples and case studies that illustrate the applications and challenges of cellular systems in different scenarios and environments.
 
Another strength of the book is that it reflects the author's extensive experience and expertise in the field of wireless communications. William C.Y. Lee is a renowned engineer and researcher who has made significant contributions to the development and advancement of cellular systems. He has worked for several leading companies and organizations, such as Bell Labs, AT&T, Motorola, and Vodafone. He has also taught and lectured at various universities and institutions, such as Stanford University, MIT, UCLA, and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He has authored or co-authored over 200 papers and 10 books on wireless communications. He has received numerous awards and honors for his achievements and innovations, such as the IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal, the IEEE Vehicular Technology Award, and the IEEE Third Millennium Medal.
 
The book is not without its limitations, however. One of the limitations is that it is somewhat outdated, as it was published more than 25 years ago. Since then, there have been many changes and developments in the field of cellular systems, such as the emergence of new standards, technologies, services, and applications. For example, the book does not cover some of the recent topics and trends, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, WiMAX, WLAN, Bluetooth, IoT, MIMO, OFDM, cognitive radio, software-defined radio, and artificial intelligence. Therefore, readers who want to learn about the latest state-of-the-art of cellular systems may need to consult other sources or books.
