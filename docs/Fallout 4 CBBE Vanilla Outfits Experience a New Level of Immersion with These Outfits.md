# How to Convert Vanilla Outfits for CBBE BodySlide in Fallout 4
 
If you are a fan of Fallout 4 and want to customize your character's appearance with different clothing options, you might be interested in using CBBE BodySlide. CBBE stands for Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer, and it is a mod that allows you to adjust your character's body shape and proportions using sliders. BodySlide is a tool that lets you create and apply custom outfits for CBBE bodies.
 
However, not all outfits in Fallout 4 are compatible with CBBE BodySlide by default. Some of them are designed for the vanilla body type, which has different dimensions and textures than CBBE. If you want to use these outfits with CBBE BodySlide, you will need to convert them first. This process involves using another tool called Outfit Studio, which is included in the BodySlide download.

## What are vanilla outfits?
 
Vanilla outfits are the clothing items that come with the base game of Fallout 4, as well as the official DLCs. They are designed for the vanilla body type, which is the default body shape and texture that Bethesda created for the game. Vanilla outfits include things like vault suits, military uniforms, dresses, suits, and more.
 
Vanilla outfits have some advantages and disadvantages compared to CBBE BodySlide outfits. On one hand, they are lore-friendly, meaning they fit the style and theme of the game world. They also do not require any additional mods or tools to use. On the other hand, they are less customizable, meaning you cannot change their shape or fit to your liking. They also may look less realistic or appealing than CBBE BodySlide outfits, depending on your preference.
